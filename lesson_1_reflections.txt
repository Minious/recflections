How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helps to quickly identify the lines which have been modified and which are subject to create bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It helps to retrieve some old data which might have been deleted.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros : having saves at the right moment
cons : knowing when the right moment is

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
No fucking idea.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log displays the history of all commits behind HEAD
git diff takes two commits IDs as parameters and display the differences between them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It's easier to go back to an older version of the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Make some coffee.
